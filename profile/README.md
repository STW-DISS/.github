# Distributed Intelligent Software Systems (DISS)

Welcome to the public code organization of the STW Distributed Intelligent Software Systems (DISS). The DISS GitHub organization serves as the central workspace for research prototypes, experimental software, and technical explorations conducted within the DISS transfer center. This space brings together engineering concepts, research activities, and hands-on experimentation in domains where distributed systems and intelligent software meet.

Our goal is to maintain a structured, transparent, and collaborative environment for code, experiments, and project materials produced in the context of academic-industry research.

## 🎯 The Mission

Our mission is bridging research, engineering practice, and knowledge transfer in advanced software system design.
It is a platform for:
	•	early-stage ideas and technical experiments,
	•	research prototypes and proof-of-concept implementations,
	•	teaching materials and student project artifacts,
	•	explorations of new architectural patterns, algorithms, and protocols,
	•	investigations into distributed intelligence, interoperability, and automation.

The content here serves as a living laboratory supporting both academic inquiry and applied research collaborations.

## 📂 What You Will Find Here

Typical repository types include:
	•	Research prototypes validating or demonstrating new ideas
	•	Proof-of-concept implementations of distributed architectures
	•	Algorithms and protocol experiments
	•	Simulation or modeling tools for exploring system behavior
	•	Teaching examples, exercises, and lab materials
	•	Reference implementations for publications or lectures
	•	Documentation sets and design explorations
	•	Internal tools used for experimentation

Wherever meaningful, repositories include documentation, architectural context, and academic-style transparency.


## 🤝 Collaboration

Collaboration is welcome within the scope of joint academic or applied projects. Public material is shared when appropriate, while in-progress work may remain internal.
